NAME
	exec-as - exec(1) with explicit argv[0]

SYNOPSIS
	exec-as FILE ARGV0 [ARGV]...

DESCRIPTION
	exec-as shall spawn the program FILE, using execvp(3),
	using ARGV0 as the value for argv[0], and the following
	arguments for the following values in argv.

NOTES
	At least two arguments is required. Since this is not
	a builtin function, it cannot be used as exec(1) without
	arguments to set file descriptors.

	Because this is not a builtin function, running this
	program would normally do an forkâ€“exec rather than
	just an exec. To just perform an exec, you need to
	use exec(1) too: exec exec-as

EXAMPLES
	'exec-as bash -bash' will run the first program in
	$PATH named bash, and set argv[0] to -bash (making it
	a login shell.) You can add addition argument as needed.
